# Simulation data processing and analysis

This project processes data from a matlab simulation of a DC microgrid. These data will be used in a scientific paper that is currently in preparation.

This project is part of the [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) movement. Data and source code will therefore be made freely available to the public.

## Description

The results of the different matlab simulations are exported in the form of a `.csv` file. This project processes data from these files and *TODO*.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Cleans raw data from matlab simulation exports.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the project initialization script: `python init.py`
4. Download the raw data and place it in the `00 RAW DATA` directory.

## Usage

Run the main script: `python main.py`

## License

This project is open source and freely reusable under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
